# FT_SELECT - @42Born2Code

A robust file browser and manager in the terminal.

## About

[ft_select](https://github.com/jon-finkel/ft_select/blob/master/ft_select.en.pdf) is the third project of the Unix branch at 42. The goal for this project is to learn more about screen oriented programs using termcap/terminfo libraries in the C programming language. It's originally just an argument viewer in the terminal but I decided to take it one step further and gave it browsing capabilities on the file system.

The main goal, however, is to build my own functional shell. Something like `zsh` and `bash`, this is what the next project at my school is about and ft_select is just a small part of it.
